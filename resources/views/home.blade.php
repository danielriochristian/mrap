      <h3> Moores Rowland </h3>
      <p> In the quarter century since our establishment in 1991, Moores Rowland has grown to become one of Indonesia’s leading financial services and advisory firms with around 450 professionals staffing offices in Jakarta and Bali.

Embracing Indonesia’s cultural diversity, these professionals come not just from across the archipelago but also the United States, Belgium, France, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Japan, India, Canada and the Philippines. Yet for all the differences in origin they are bound by a common goal – to help our clients grow and prosper, for only in this way can we grow too.

To achieve this we follow a unique way of taking care of today’s challenges while seeking a better tomorrow, for we see the world not just as it is but as it can and should be. In this regard we act on our words, as exemplified by our long-standing commitment to the hiring of disadvantaged staff, which is an important statement of who we are. Your business is equally important to us and we will continue to build our capabilities so that we can better meet your needs.

Nor is our focus solely on Indonesia, for as a member firm of Praxity AISBL, the world’s largest Alliance of independent financial services, advisory and certification firms, we can draw on the expertise of thousands of like-minded professionals in countries around the world. This is of particular benefit for clients with global ambitions as our Partners can personally recommend their counterparts in offices abroad who can provide that local knowledge in ensuring solutions that meet your needs.

We may not be the biggest, but there is a reason that besides being a member firm of Praxity, we’re also an Organizational Stakeholder of GRI, and GNI-accredited international assessor. We’re proud of the trust we have earned, and that clients perceive the value we offer through our extended range of services.  </p>
